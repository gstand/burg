Burger must contain boolean fields called ketchup, lettuce, tomato and cheese. It must also contain an integer field called patties.
PubBurgers have two additional fields, both Strings, called FancySauce and FancyBun respectively.
Tomatoes cost $.25, cheese costs $.50, and burgers start at $4.00, with $1 added for each patty after 1, maximum 3.
If a burger is a pub burger, it should cost $2 more than a burger with exactly the same condiments.
Two Burgers are equal if their condiments and status as a PubBurger are all the same.
